## Introduction

`frost` is a workflow tool. Inspired by [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), [Mage](https://magefile.org/), [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) and others, but with some important differences.

| Feature              | Frost | Make | Mage | Go-Task |
|----------------------|-------|------|------|---------|
| Fast                 | ‚úîÔ∏è     | ‚úîÔ∏è    | ‚úîÔ∏è    | ‚úîÔ∏è       |
| Plugins              | ‚úîÔ∏è     |      | ‚úîÔ∏è    |         |
| Bash Support         | ‚úîÔ∏è     | ‚úîÔ∏è    | ‚úîÔ∏è    | ‚úîÔ∏è       |
| Target Flags         | ‚úîÔ∏è     | ‚úîÔ∏è¬ß   | ‚úîÔ∏è¬ß   | ‚úîÔ∏è¬ß¬ß     |
| Autocomplete         | ‚úîÔ∏è     | ‚úîÔ∏è    |      | ‚úîÔ∏è       |
| Parallelism          | ‚úîÔ∏è     |      | ‚úîÔ∏è‚Ä†   |         |
| Imports (Namespaced) | ‚úîÔ∏è     | ‚úîÔ∏è    | ‚úîÔ∏è‚Ä°   | ‚úîÔ∏è‚Ä°      |
| *File                | Go    | Make | Go   | Yaml    |

¬ß Target behavior can only be modified with environment variables

¬ß¬ß Target behavior can be modified with environment and can also can be templated with go templating prior to evaluation and execution.

‚Ä† Doesn't support limiting of parallelism ([#273](https://github.com/magefile/mage/pull/273))

‚Ä° Mage doesn't currently support nested namespaces ([#152](https://github.com/magefile/mage/issues/152)), and Task support for imports is still experimental

---

Make is fast, but for any sort of complex logic, I found myself writing bash scripts, and I agree with Mage in regards to make/bash:

> Makefiles are hard to read and hard to write. Mostly because makefiles are essentially fancy bash scripts with significant white space and additional make-related syntax. Go is superior to bash for any non-trivial task involving branching, looping, anything that‚Äôs not just straight line execution of commands.

Mage makes heavy use of code generation in order to create the resulting binary, and I found that to be a high barrier to entry for contributing to the project.

I've been itching to write my own CLI for awhile now, and I think I finally have a reason to.
