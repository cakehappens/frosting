# Minimal Example

The Newbie Tutorial

## Imagine

Imagine that this is the _root_ of your project repo. It doesn't matter what language, node, python, go, etc.

The recommended approach is to put frosting in a subfolder, as to not interfere if you are building a go application.

## Getting Started

Compile into a binary

```shell
go build -o frost ./frosting
```
